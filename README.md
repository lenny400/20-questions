20 Questions is a guessing game in which one player chooses a secret object and the other player asks yes/no questions to try to identity the chosen object. In this version, the human will be the chooser and begin a round by choosing an object. The computer will be the guesser and attempt to guess that object by asking a series of yes/no questions until it thinks it knows the answer. Then, the computer makes a guess; if its guess is correct, the computer wins, and otherwise the human player wins. If the computer loses, it will add the chosen object to its knowledge base so it will be able to guess it the next time it plays. This Java program utilizes recursion to traverse the binary tree of questions and answers.
